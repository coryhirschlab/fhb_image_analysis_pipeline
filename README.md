Julian Cooper Hirsch Lab FHB Image Analysis Pipeline

Deep learning based RGB image analysis pipeline for quantifying Fusarium head blight on wheat.

automatic_image_annotation: Compare disease inferences from automatic image analysis (AIA) pipeline to manual field ratings (MFR), manual image annotation (MIA) of the n200 inter rater reliability (IRR) spike image subset, and the MIA n10K large scale annotation (LSA) spike image subset at a spike and plot scale. 

manual_field_ratings: Compare disease ratings amongst five raters visually scoring disease in the field.

manual_field_ratings: Compare disease ratings amongst five raters manually annotating disease on wheat spike images.
